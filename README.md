I will talk about important things of this task. I created register and login system for people of two categories. One is administartor, who I think is one person. And second for many customers. I created "Administartor" middleware. I did that to separate the two categories. In this example the Administartor can do more changes and see more things. To see the difference of those categories you only have to add "1" value for "type" column in "users" table. That's enought. I hope that I understood your task and you will like my job. Please say your answear as soon as possible. 



Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Best,
Arman Bleyan
